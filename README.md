# Sleeping-Barbers

Extend the original sleeping-barber problem to a multiple sleeping barbers problem where many customers visit a barbershop and receive a haircut service from any one of the available barbers in the shop.

A barbershop consists of a waiting room with n waiting chairs and a barber room with m barber chairs. If there are no customers to be served, all the barbers go to sleep. If a customer enters the barbershop and all chairs (including both, waiting and barber chairs) are occupied, then the customer leaves the shop.
If all the barbers are busy but chairs are available, then the customer sits in one of the free waiting chairs. If the barbers are asleep, the customer wakes up one of the barbers.
